# INVESTMENT-ANALYSIS-DASHBOARD (EXCEL & POWER QUERY)
## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing an investment dataset using Power Query and Microsoft Excel to uncover trends, patterns, and insights. The goal was to transform raw data into an interactive dashboard that supports data-driven decision-making.
The dataset contains information on 1,000 investors, including investment amounts, accrued interest, investment types, regions, and yearly trends.
## Tools Used
Microsoft Excel
Power Query

Pivot Tables

Excel Charts (Line, Pie, Column)

Excel Slicers

## DASHBOARD PREVIEW
Below is a snapshot of the interactive Excel dashboard alongside the underlying data table and pivot table summaries used to support the analysis. The dashboard presents key KPIs, charts, and slicers, while the tables and pivots provide the structured foundation for data aggregation and insights.

## Data Preparation
- Cleaned and transformed the dataset using Power Query
- Created structured tables for analysis
- Built Pivot Tables to support KPIs and dashboard visuals
- Added slicers for interactive filtering

##  Analysis & Visualizations
* Analyzed investment trends from 2018–2024 using a line chart to observe changes in investor participation over time.
* *Used a pie chart to visualize the percentage distribution of total investment by type (stocks, bonds, crypto, mutual funds, and real estate).
* Created a column chart to analyze total investment by region, highlighting Lagos as the highest contributor and Port Harcourt as the lowest.
* Built Pivot Tables to support KPI calculations and dashboard visuals.
* Added slicers to enable interactive filtering across investment type, region, and year.

## Insights from the Analysis
* Investment activity declined in the later years, indicating reduced participation or shifting market conditions.
* Investors maintain diversified portfolios, reducing over-reliance on a single investment type.
* Lagos dominates total investment, reinforcing its position as a financial hub, while Port Harcourt shows lower investment levels.
* Accrued interest trends suggest consistent returns relative to investment amounts.
* Interactive filtering allows deeper exploration of patterns across different segments.

## RECOMMENDATIONS
Based on the insights from this analysis, organizations and investors can take the following steps to optimize engagement and returns:
1. Encourage Investment Participation in Later Years
    * The trend analysis shows a decline in investment activity in recent years. Financial institutions and investment platforms could create targeted campaigns, incentives, or educational programs to re-engage      investors.
2. Promote Portfolio Diversification Awareness
    * While most investors maintain diversified portfolios, continuous education about the benefits of spreading investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, crypto, mutual funds, real estate) could further      reduce risk and optimize returns.
3. Focus on Regional Investment Gaps
    * Lagos leads in investment contributions, while regions like Port Harcourt lag behind. Localized awareness programs or tailored investment products could encourage participation in underrepresented regions.
4. Monitor Accrued Interest Performance
    * The consistent relationship between investment amounts and accrued interest suggests steady returns. Institutions can use this insight to design better interest schemes or highlight successful plans to         attract more investors.
5. Leverage Interactive Dashboards for Decision-Making
    * The use of dashboards, KPIs, and slicers demonstrates that visual and interactive tools improve understanding and decision-making. Organizations should adopt such tools for internal reporting and investor      engagement.
